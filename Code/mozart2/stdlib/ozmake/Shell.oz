%%% {Shell.executeCommand CMD}
%%% {Shell.executeProgram CMD}
%%%     CMD is a list whose 1st element is the program to execute, and
%%%     the remaining elements are the arguments to this program.  In
%%%     order to be run by the shell, CMD must be transformed into a
%%%     virtual string with all elements appropriately quoted.  The
%%%     quote character is " for Windows and ' otherwise.  With
%%%     executeCommand, the command is explicitly passed to a shell.
%%%
%%% {Shell.quoteUsing CMD QUOTE}
%%%     CMD is as above and QUOTE is a virtual string to use as the
%%%     quoting character.
%%%
%%% {Shell.toUserVS CMD}
%%%     calls Shell.quoteUsing with an empty QUOTE.
