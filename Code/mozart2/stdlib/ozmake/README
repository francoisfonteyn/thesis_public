An executable is distinguished by the .exe extension.  On all
platforms they are installed both with and without the extension.

A rule is represented by a record:

        rule(tool:TOOL file:FILE options:[OPTIONS...])

Options for cc:
        library(foo) -> -lfoo

* MAKEFILE

makefile(
  bin      : [ FILES... ]
  lib      : [ FILES... ]
  doc      : [ FILES... ]
  src      : [ FILES... ]
  depends  :
     o( T1 : [ D1 D2 ... ]
        ...
      )
  rules    :
     o( T1 : TOOL1(S1)
        T2 : TOOL2(S2)
        ...
      )
  uri      : URI
  mogul    : MOGUL
  author   : [ A1 A2 ... ]
  released : DATE
  clean    : [ GLOB... ]
  veryclean: [ GLOB... ]
)

The src targets are included in the distribution.  In particular, if a
bin or lib target occurs in src, it is prebuilt for the distribution
and the sources necessary to build it are not included.

* PACKAGE DATABASE

there should be a single entry for each package. the only way to have
multiple versions of the `same' package is to actually make the
packages of these versions different, maybe by adding a version number
to the mogul id and doing the same for the uri.

the database entry should only record the files that have actually
been installed.

package(
  mogul     : MOGUL
  uri       : URI
  author    : [ A1 A2 ... ]
  released  : DATE
  installed : DATE
  blurb     : TEXT
  info_html : TEXT
  info_text : TEXT
  files     : FILE
  lost      : FILES
  zombies   : FILES
  )

* INSTALLATION

** is the package already in the database?

*** yes

**** --grade=none (default)
signal an error
**** --grade=same
release dates must be identical
**** --grade=up
new package must have more recent release date
**** --grade=down
new package must have less recent release date
**** --grade=any
ok

*** no
just fine

** do package files collide with database files?

*** yes

**** --replacefiles
just fine
**** all files are owned by an installed version of the package
if --grade=none signal an error (already done earlier)
**** else
signal an error

** install files keeping track of which ones are overwritting files in the database

*** for all other packages
move the affected files to their lost list
*** if the package is installed
take all the non-overwritten files of the previous installation
**** if --extendpackage
leave them alone, keep them in the new installation
**** if --keepzombies
move them to the zombie list of the new installation
**** else
remove them
*** update database entry
using new installation

* RECURSING INTO SUBDIRECTORIES

the makefile record may have a subdirs feature which holds a list of
subdirectories (bare filenames).
