This example shows extensions of the grid structure.

Run the example below.

The empty keyword leaves a blank space.
The continue keyword allow a widget to spread over more than just one column (or line in case of a lr widget).

Note that empty, continue and newline are NOT widgets (they can't be glued for example).
