This examples shows the rubberframe widget.

A rubberframe can place different widgets either horizontally or vertically so that the user can interactively change the horizontal space taken by each widgets.

The lrrubberframe and tdrubberframe behave as the td and lr widgets except that they don't support a grid structure (newline, empty and continue keywords are not supported). You can place as many widgets as you want horizontally or vertically.

Cfr the td and lr documentation.
