This example shows the button widget.

A button widget is the standard push button that triggers an action when clicked.

See the Interaction examples for details about the format of the action parameter.

The return parameter allows to define a variable that will be binded when the window is closed :
- binded to true iff it is the execution of the action of the button that closed the window.
- binded to false otherwise.
