This example shows the toplevel widget.

The very first td or lr widget when QTk builds a window is the toplevel widget. It can be used to control the window properties as shown, hidden or iconic and also the title, position and so on.

The toplevel widget have supplementary parameters, as title and geometry that allow you to control the window.

You can also obtain informations about the window state by calling the winfo method of the toplevel object (cfr documentation)
