This example shows the line and space widgets.

The tdline widget is a vertical line, so it skips horizontal space.
The lrline widget is a horizontal line, so it skips vertical space.
The tdspace and lrspace are equivalent to tdline and lrline without any line.

You can specify the space you want to skip by the width parameter.
