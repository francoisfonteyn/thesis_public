This example shows the basis or geomety management.

In QTk, the geometry of the different widgets are organized by two widgets :
td (top down) and lr (left to right)

Run the example below.
Replace td by lr and rerun to see how the labels change their organization.

Note : when you build a window with QTk, the topmost widget must always be either td or lr : {QTk.build td(....)} or {QTk.build lr(....)}
