However under Windows the Tcl/Tk process that serves as the front-end graphical user interface can only use the UTF-8 character encoding. This is a Windows specific problem as Tcl/Tk uses also ISO8859-1 undex Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X. </P><P>Many characters are common between the two encodings, however more specialized ones like accentuated characters are not. QTk embeds an automatic translation mechanism between the two sets under Windows. Mozart application developpers should care only about the ISO8859-1 encoding system on all platforms including Windows. The translation mechanism works like this: </P><UL><LI><P>If a character exists in both encodings, then it is directly translated.</P></LI><LI><P>ISO8859-1 doesn't support the euro currency symbol.
