# Mozart-Oz v2 - Boost-based host

This is a stand-alone host for [Mozart2](https://github.com/mozart/mozart2),
based on the Boost library. It combines the Mozart2 VM library and the
Boost-based environment into a stand-alone emulator.

Although it is possible to build this component separately, it is designed to be
built as part of Mozart2, which see.
