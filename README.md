# Mozart2: Comprehensions
--- 
This project has been made in the context of my Master's Thesis at Université Catholique de Louvain in the faculty called Ecole Polytechnique de Louvain (Louvain School of Engineering).
The goal of this project was to implement list comprehensions in Mozart2. Additionally I added basic record comprehensions. This implies keeping all the possibilities of Mozart2 available with these new structures.
